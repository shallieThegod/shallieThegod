### Heyy! ðŸ˜„
#### My name is Shallie, She/Her, I'm all-knowing so it's hard to pick an interest but I'm currently a Technical Writer with good frontend development skills.
#### When I'm not tech-ing you'd mostly find me speaking up against the patriarchy, fighting for more inclusion of minority women in different sectors of our world or simply talking politics.
##### I love my boyfriend, the rain, dark rooms, freshly washed sheets, self-care and good food.

#### Please read my [blog](https://shallieverse.hashnode.dev) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shalliethegod/)
